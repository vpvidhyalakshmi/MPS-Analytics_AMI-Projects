# Wine Classification using Gaussian Naive Bayes

**Dataset Description**

The 'load_wine' dataset from the 'scikit-learn' library contains chemical analysis data of wines grown in the same region in Italy. It includes 178 samples with 13 features, such as alcohol content and malic acid, used for classification into three different wine categories.
  
**Project Description**  

This project utilizes the wine dataset from scikit-learn to train a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier, predicting wine class labels from chemical features. It evaluates the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, providing insights into its predictive effectiveness.

**Key Objectives**
