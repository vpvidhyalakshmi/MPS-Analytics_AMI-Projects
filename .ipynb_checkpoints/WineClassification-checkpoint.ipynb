It classifies the data based on the assumption that every feature in the class is independent of any other feature present in the class. The name \"naive\" is derived as this assumption is very naive. However, this technique is found to be very effective on large and complex datasets and it also helps in building the models to make quick decisions. This classifier algorithm is frequently used in spam filtration, Sentimental analysis, and classifying articles."

    "The wine dataset is loaded from the scikit-learn library datasets. It is split into training and testing sets using a stratified sampling method with a random state to reproduce the results consistently. A Gaussian Naive Bayes model is then trained using the training data to predict the class labels of the wine in the test dataset. Finally, the performance of the prediction model is evaluated using various metrics, including the accuracy score, which measures the fraction of correct predictions made by the model. These evaluation metrics are displayed to provide insights into the effectiveness of the model."

    " The Gaussian Naive Bayes model built using the training dataset is found to have 100% accuracy in predicting the class of wines when tested with the testing dataset. Also, it is noted that, when the sample method is not stratified, the accuracy of the prediction model for same size of train and test samples is only 97.7%. Thus, we can conclude that stratified sampling method with 75% of the data for training the Gaussian Naive Bayes model is the best model for this wine dataset. "
